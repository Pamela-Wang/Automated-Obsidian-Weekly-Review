# Intro 
This is a starter kit for beginners to obsidian. It is a simplified version of my vault with my daily and weekly note templates, the folder structure for my periodic notes (daily, weekly, monthly etc) and the plugin settings I use.

# Installation
1. Download this folder 
2. Open the Potato Vault using Obsidian

This is a more detailed guide on how the automation of the weekly review works. So it goes into the details of using obsidian dataview rollups, the structure of my weekly review (based off GTD) and also some things to note.

# Bug fixes
I try to cover all possible bugs in the [![Detailed Automated Weekly Review Guide](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tUWjyzvljfs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUWjyzvljfs) Video but here are some things that will break the system.
- If you change the folder structure, you have to update the Periodic Note Plugin Settings
- If you change the naming format of the daily or weekly review, you need to update the templates and the Periodic Note Plugin Settings
- If you click on the link to the weekly page (on the daily page) without first creating the note using "Periodic Notes: Open weekly note", you will get a blank page. Fix this by 
	1) Delete the blank page 
	2) Open Command Palette (CMD + P)
	3) Type in "weekly"
	4) Click on "Periodic Notes: Open weekly note"
